# Trackmania Dopamine Simulator

## Lore

Have you ever spent hours and hours making the most beautiful, creative, and satisfying a map in Trackmania, published it on https://trackmania.exchange, promoted it to all your friends on countless different discord communities, only for nobody to play it? Or even worse, people to play and and then **not tell you if they enjoyed it or not?!**. Well you've come to the right place! 

With the popularity of [Flink's Random Map Challenge](https://flinkblog.de/RMC/), all sorts of Trackmania players have an incredibly small change of randomly getting dropped into your fantastic map. If you are a self-centered, validation-seeking, parasocial-andy like me, you spend your evenings refreshing https://trackmania.exchange or https://trackmania.io hoping to see that someone has finally played your map. If you get lucky, it might even be a streamer who played it! In such a case, any logical human would head directly to https://twitch.tv, find that streamer's channel, search out the corresponding day's VOD, and manually scrub through the entire recording until you find the timestamp where our beloved streamer played your ~~horrendous~~ map.

## So how's this work?

It doesn't... yet.
